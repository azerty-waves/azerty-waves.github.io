<p>
  Hello World! <br>
  I am a student engineer researcher in the field of science and music</p>
<p>
  Fascinated by electronics and music since my early childhood, my long-term goal is to work in the field of musical interaction and sound synthesis.
  This goal guided my graduate studies and led me to assimilate and apply concepts on musical sciences in my personal projects (making acoustic and electronic instruments).

<p>
  This website hosts my productions on the interaction between science and music but also my working methods.
  I hope you will find what you are looking for in these few web pages.
  If you want to contact me and talk about music and science, you can use my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/azerty_waves/">Instagram</a>.

<p>
  To you
